# Sidekick Generator 5e

This React app is still a work in progress. 
Calling data from [open5e](open5e.com), the app will display creatures that the user will be able to select and modify by selecting a level and a class as per the rules provided in *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*, to produce an automated charactersheet for a sidekick. Users will be able to save this character sheet as a PDF.
The intent here is streamline the creation of Sidekicks in D&D 5e.

Once deployed, I will provide a link to the website for free use.

Thanks to [open5e](open5e.com) for providing the open source API.
And thanks to Madison Lowe [@madisonlowe](https://github.com/madisonlowe), Fiona Kitchen [@fkit00](https://github.com/fkit00) and Andy Johnson [@multi-vit](https://github.com/multi-vit) for there help on this project.
